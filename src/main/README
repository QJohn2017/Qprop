* Example: Gaussian wave packet in the Coulomb scalar field + linearly polarized light field

** Assuming we have the linearly polarized light field with sin^2 vector potential: 
   A(t) = -E0 / omega * sin^2( omega * t / ( 2 * Nc ) ) * sin( omega * t + phi )
   omega = 0.0227817 ( wavelength of 2um )
   E_0 = -0.0168 ( light intensity I = 1 x 10^13 W/cm^2 )
   number of cycle Nc = 0.5
   carrier phase phi = 0

** Assuming we have the Coulomb potential as the scalar potential:
   V(r) = - charge / r, charge = 1.0


* What do we want? 

** We want to analyze the spatial movement of wavepacket in the combined fields

** We will analyze the projection of wave function onto the eigenstate of atomic hydrogen

** We will calculate the energy spectra for total or partial wave after the light is switched off

** or even more, we will analyze the momentum distribution 


* How should we do?

** find out the hydrogen 1s state for projection
*** enter "parameters.cc":
    r_max = 400;
    delta_r = 0.1;
*** enter "Makefile":
    TARGET	=	h1s
*** Make and run "h1s", generate the wavefunction file "wf-9.dat" and information file "info-9.dat"
    note the energy output: it should be -0.5 for the hydrogen in the ground state
    the following setting in the file "h1s.cc",
    "  T_sclpot::coulomb spx; "
    "  toolbox::set_charge( 1.0 );" 
    is used to correctly calculate the energy.

** generate a gaussian wavepacket
*** enter "parameters.cc":
    r_max = 80; 
    // this is because the gaussian will be expanded with spherical harmonics 
    // with the coefficient of modified spherical Bessel function, unfortunately for larger r it is
    // not so easy to get convergent. so we decide to put the wavepacket on a small grid firstly 
    // then regrid it later.
    n_l = 60;  
*** enter "Makefile":
    TARGET	=	gaussian
*** Make and run "gaussian", generate the wavefunction file "wf-0.dat" and information file "info-0.dat"
    note the energy output: for 3D gaussian wavepacket in the free space ( means no potential presented. 
    In the file "gaussian.cc", we set all the scalar potential to "none" ), the energy should be 3/2 * alpha,
    which is related to the width of the gaussian wavepacket ( these parameters are predefined in the file
    util/sp_type.cc, but can be accessed via the class T_sclpot::gaussian )

** real-time propagation in the combined fields
*** enter "parameters.cc":
    r_max = 800;
    // now we need a larger grid for the wavepacket to move and spread
    t0 = 41.7614
    // here we want to simulate the process when the electron appear in the space when the 
    // electric field E(t) reaches maximum (think about Keldysh tunnel ionization), that is 
    // why we set it to this value.
*** enter "Makefile":
     TARGET	=	prop
*** Make and run "prop"
    this would be a long run. the program will read in the wavefunctions produced by the previous 
    initialization, and set the hamiltonian to its correct form: coulomb potential + vector potential.
    Note: the vector potential is shifted so the TDSE solver sees value 0 of vector at time t0, to pre
    a momentum "kick" to the wavepacket (or say, for Qprop, the momentum of the wavepacket is A(t0) at 
    time t0. Shift of A(t) has no effects on the electric field, but will affect the initial condition.
    In this case, after the shift, the "mass center" of the wavepacket will come back; otherwise, it won't).
    The definition of electric field can be found at util/vp_type.cc.
     
** spectral analysis
   to be continued ...
